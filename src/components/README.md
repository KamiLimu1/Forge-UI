# Component Registry

**This is the single source of truth for every component in this repository.**

Before building any component, check this list. If it exists here, use it — do not build a duplicate. When you add a new component, add it to this file in the same PR.

## ui/ — Generic, reusable, no Forge domain knowledge

These components have no knowledge of sessions, mentees, attendance, or any Forge concept. They accept generic props and render UI. They must work in any context.

| Component | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Button` | `ui/Button.tsx` | Primary, ghost, and danger variants. Sizes: sm, md, lg. Supports `isLoading` and `fullWidth`. |
| `Input` | `ui/Input.tsx` | Text input with optional label, error message, and hint. Accessible — wires `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` automatically. |
| `Spinner` | `ui/Spinner.tsx` | Loading indicator. Sizes: sm, md, lg. |

**Not yet built** (build these when first needed, following CONVECTIONS.md):
Avatar, Badge, Card, Modal, Toast, Select, Checkbox, Textarea

## forge/ — Forge domain components

These are built by composing `ui/` components. They understand Forge concepts — they accept typed Forge data as props (sessions, mentees, attendance records, etc.).

| Component | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _(none yet)_ | — | — |

**Candidates** (build when the relevant page is being built):
SessionRow, AttendanceToggle, GraduationStatus, TrackBadge, PointsCard, LeaderboardRow, MenteeCard, SessionCard

---

## layout/ — Structural shell components

These define the structural skeleton of authenticated views.

| Component | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _(none yet)_ | — | — |

**Candidates** (build when the dashboard shell is being built):
Sidebar, TopBar, PageWrapper

## Rules for adding to this registry

1. Add the entry to this table in the same PR as the component itself.
2. Include a one-line description that explains what the component does and any important props or variants.
3. Move candidates from "Not yet built" to the table when implemented.
4. Never remove a component from this list without also deleting the file — the two must stay in sync.
